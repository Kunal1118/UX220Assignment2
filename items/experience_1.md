<h2>Traveling to Paris, France</h2>
<br>
<h4>
I traveled to Paris, France during the summer of 2019. 
The beautiful architecture, delicious cuisine, and rich 
history of the city made the trip exceptional. My favorite 
memory was watching the sunset from the top of the Eiffel 
Tower with my loved ones. The crowds at some tourist spots 
could be overwhelming.
