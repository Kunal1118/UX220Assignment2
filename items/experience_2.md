<h2>Learning to Play Piano</h2>
<br>
<h4>
I started learning to play the piano in the fall of 2020 and continued practicing regularly. 
Learning to create beautiful music was incredibly rewarding and fulfilling. My favorite memory 
was playing a piece I had been practicing for months at a small recital and receiving applause 
from the audience. It could be frustrating at times, especially when trying to master challenging 
pieces.
