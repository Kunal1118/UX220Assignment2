<h2>Starting My Job with City of Mississauga</h2>
<br>
<h4>
I began my new job in the Fall of 2018. The opportunity for personal and professional growth was excellent, and I enjoyed the challenges. 
My favorite memory was celebrating my promotion to Deck Supervisor. The long commute to work was a bit of a hassle in the beginning but once I got
a car it was pretty easy.
