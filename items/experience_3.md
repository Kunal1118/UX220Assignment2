<h2>Hiking in the Rocky Mountains</h2>
<br>
<h4>
I went hiking in the Rocky Mountains during the summer of 2018. The stunning mountain vistas 
and the feeling of being one with nature were amazing. My favorite memory was reaching the 
summit of a challenging trail and taking in the breathtaking views. Dealing with altitude 
sickness on one of the hikes was quite unpleasant.
